1. Derivation of the Relationship Between Period and Radius

For a body in a circular orbit around a much larger central mass (e.g., planet around a star), we equate gravitational force and centripetal force:

Gravitational Force:



Centripetal Force:



Equating:


The orbital period  is related to the orbital speed  and the circumference:


Thus, for circular orbits:


This is Kepler's Third Law for circular orbits.

2. Implications for Astronomy

Mass Calculation: Knowing  and , we can rearrange Kepler's law to calculate the mass  of a central body.


Distance Measurement: Knowing the period and mass, one can derive the distance (orbital radius).

Predictive Tool: It's essential in predicting satellite motion and planning space missions.

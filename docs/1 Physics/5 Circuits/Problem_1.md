Algorithm for Calculating Equivalent Resistance Using Graph Theory
Overview
This algorithm uses graph theory to calculate the equivalent resistance of a resistor network. The circuit is represented as an undirected graph where vertices are nodes (junctions) and edges are resistors with associated resistance values. The algorithm iteratively simplifies the graph by identifying and reducing series and parallel resistor combinations until a single equivalent resistance remains between the source and sink nodes.
Pseudocode
Algorithm CalculateEquivalentResistance(graph G, source s, sink t)
    Input: Graph G(V, E) with edges labeled by resistance values, source node s, sink node t
    Output: Equivalent resistance between s and t

    // Initialize
    equivalent_resistance = 0
    G' = copy of G  // Working copy of the graph

    While G' has more than two nodes (s and t) or more than one edge between s and t:
        // Step 1: Identify series connections
        for each node n in G' (excluding s and t):
            if degree(n) == 2:  // Node connects exactly two resistors
                neighbors = {u, v} where (u, n) and (n, v) are edges
                r1 = resistance of edge (u, n)
                r2 = resistance of edge (n, v)
                // Replace series connection with single resistor
                Remove node n and edges (u, n), (n, v)
                Add edge (u, v) with resistance r1 + r2

        // Step 2: Identify parallel connections
        for each pair of nodes (u, v) in G':
            if multiple edges exist between u and v:
                parallel_resistances = {r_i for each edge (u, v)}
                // Calculate equivalent parallel resistance
                r_eq = 1 / (sum(1/r_i for r_i in parallel_resistances))
                // Replace parallel edges with single edge
                Remove all edges between u and v
                Add edge (u, v) with resistance r_eq

        // Step 3: Check for convergence
        if no series or parallel reductions were made:
            Break  // Avoid infinite loop if graph cannot be simplified further

    // Final step: Handle remaining edge(s) between s and t
    if G' has one edge (s, t):
        equivalent_resistance = resistance of edge (s, t)
    else if G' has multiple edges between s and t:
        parallel_resistances = {r_i for each edge (s, t)}
        equivalent_resistance = 1 / (sum(1/r_i for r_i in parallel_resistances))
    else:
        equivalent_resistance = infinity  // No path exists

    Return equivalent_resistance

Explanation
The algorithm iteratively simplifies the graph by:

Series Reduction: Identifies nodes with degree 2 (connected to exactly two resistors). These represent resistors in series. The node is removed, and the two resistors are replaced with a single edge whose resistance is the sum of the two (R1 + R2).
Parallel Reduction: Identifies multiple edges between the same pair of nodes, indicating resistors in parallel. These are replaced with a single edge whose resistance is calculated using the parallel formula: 1/R_eq = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + ... + 1/Rn.
Convergence Check: If no reductions are possible, the algorithm stops to avoid infinite loops, which can occur in complex graphs with cycles that cannot be reduced to series or parallel combinations alone.
Final Output: Once the graph is reduced to a single edge (or multiple parallel edges) between the source and sink, the equivalent resistance is computed.

Handling Nested Combinations
Nested series and parallel combinations are handled naturally through iterative reduction:

Series in Parallel: If a subgraph contains a series chain (e.g., R1 + R2) in parallel with another resistor (R3), the series reduction first combines R1 and R2 into a single resistor (R1 + R2). Then, the parallel reduction combines this with R3 using the parallel formula.
Parallel in Series: If parallel resistors (e.g., R1 || R2) are in series with another resistor (R3), the parallel reduction first computes the equivalent resistance of R1 || R2, and then the series reduction adds R3.
The iterative nature ensures that nested structures are simplified layer by layer, as each reduction step exposes new series or parallel patterns.

Example Cases

Simple Series and Parallel:

Input: Three resistors: R1 = 2Ω, R2 = 3Ω in series, in parallel with R3 = 6Ω.
Process:
Series: Combine R1 and R2 → 2 + 3 = 5Ω.
Parallel: Combine 5Ω || 6Ω → 1/(1/5 + 1/6) = 30/11 ≈ 2.727Ω.


Output: ~2.727Ω.


Nested Configuration:

Input: R1 = 4Ω in series with a parallel combination of R2 = 8Ω and R3 = 8Ω.
Process:
Parallel: R2 || R3 = 1/(1/8 + 1/8) = 4Ω.
Series: 4Ω + 4Ω = 8Ω.


Output: 8Ω.


Complex Graph with Cycles:

Input: A Wheatstone bridge-like graph with five resistors (R1 = 1Ω, R2 = 2Ω, R3 = 3Ω, R4 = 4Ω, R5 = 5Ω) forming a cycle with a cross resistor.
Process:
If reducible to series/parallel, iteratively simplify (e.g., reduce parallel paths or series chains).
If non-reducible (like a Wheatstone bridge), the algorithm may terminate early, indicating a need for advanced techniques (e.g., Kirchhoff’s laws).
For simplicity, assume a reducible cycle: Combine series paths (e.g., R1 + R2), then parallel with R5, and so on.


Output: Depends on specific configuration, but follows series/parallel rules.



Efficiency Analysis

Time Complexity: 
Series reduction: O(V) per iteration (checking degrees of all vertices).
Parallel reduction: O(E) per iteration (checking edges for multiplicity).
Iterations depend on graph size and structure, typically O(V + E) per iteration, with up to O(V) iterations in worst cases (linear chains). Overall: O(V * (V + E)).


Space Complexity: O(V + E) for storing the graph and its copy.
Limitations: The algorithm assumes the graph can be reduced using only series and parallel combinations. Non-reducible graphs (e.g., Wheatstone bridges) require additional techniques like delta-star transformations or solving linear equations (Kirchhoff’s laws).
Improvements:
Use a priority queue to prioritize reductions (e.g., series before parallel).
Incorporate delta-star transformations for non-reducible graphs.
Leverage graph libraries like NetworkX for efficient traversal and manipulation.
